[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rcmaples/sputnikapp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rcmaples/sputnikapp)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What?

Sputnik is the missing dashboard for GitHub. Once users register and authorize the app on their GitHub profile, we will display relevant links and information about the projects and people that the user follows.

The Dashboard aggregates data into four sections:

- Starred - displays public activity on starred repos
- Following - displays public activity from GitHub accounts you follow
- Trending - displays trending repos for exploration
- Repos - displays any activity on your own repos, forks, branches, PRs, etc...

See a live version at https://www.sputnikapp.com (_note: WIP_ demo account doesn't work)

## Why?

I've frequently found myself beating my head against GitHub's more 'social' aspects. Either getting hit with too much information or none at all. The goal of Sputnik is to create an informative and useful dashboard to keep track of the projects you're actually interested in - in an easy to navigate and sensible manner.

## How? (Technology Stack)

- React
- Node

## Other important information:

This repo relies on an external backend. Current backend can be found at [rcmaples/sputnik-server](https://github.com/rcmaples/sputnik-server). In order to work with Sputnik, you will need to clone both repos.

**Currenly deploying to Heroku, so be sure to set up a Heroku build file for deployment!**
